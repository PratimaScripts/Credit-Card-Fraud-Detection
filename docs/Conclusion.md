# Conclusion

This thesis shows the simple,cost-effective and efficient solution to detect and stop fraud. The solution uses tools and technologies like ....
with ML-based fraud detection mechanism using various algorithms and neural networks. The solution is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The solution is deployed on AWS cloud using AWS SageMaker. IEEE CIS Fraud Detection dataset is used for training and testing the model. The solution is tested on AWS SageMaker and the results are compared with the results of the same dataset on Kaggle. The results show that the solution is able to detect fraud with 99.9% accuracy and 99.9% precision.
