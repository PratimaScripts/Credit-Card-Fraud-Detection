## Deployment Guide

The instructions provided in this repository refer to several tools and libraries for conducting data analysis and creating visualizations. This is a brief overview of the installations for these tools and libraries, please refer to official documentation for in-depth details.

**Python** : Head over to `https://www.python.org/` and navigate to specific `Downloads` section for instructions based on your operating system. Download the latest stable release of Python for your computer and operating system. Verify the successful installation by entering `python` in the command window terminal - a response from python interpreter should be received including it's version number.

**Jupyter Notebook** : The Jupyter notebook environment helps in analyzing the financial transactions data. Navigate to `Getting started with the classic Jupyter Notebook` section in the official Jupyter website `https://jupyter.org/install`. and install Jupyter Notebook as per the given instructions. If you are not already familiar with usage of Jupyter, refer to `https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running` for further details on how to run Jupyter Notebooks.

**Anaconda** : Instead of installing above tools individually, a popular alternative is to use open source Anaconda Individual Edition distribution that includes Python, R, necessary tools like Jupyter Notebooks, and commonly used packages such as Pandas and NumPy by default as part of it's installation. Refer to `https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual` for further details.

**Additional Packages** : Additional packages necessary for data analysis and visualizations can be installed by referring to the install instructions from official sources. For example, `pandas` library for python can be installed using either `conda install pandas` or `pip install pandas` command as mentioned in `https://pypi.org/project/pandas/`. These packages can also be installed from within the notebooks as highlighted on top in the example notebooks.
